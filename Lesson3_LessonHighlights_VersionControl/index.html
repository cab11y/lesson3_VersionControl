            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a method of recording changes to a project or file over time. The VCS records every version and every save to a file and saves it for the developer’s future reference. It saves the project as it was at a certain time and the changes and differences that were associated with it. Also, the files are never overwritten, so if the user’s computer crashes, the project’s most recent version can be recovered, so work can continue. There are three types of Version Control Systems: Local, Centralized, and Distributed. Local VCSs are simple databases that keep all the changes to files under revision control. Centralized VCSs are a centralized place with a single server that clients can use to connect to and view all versioned files. Distributed VCSs, like Git, Mercurial, and Darcs, allow clients to view what is in their repository, meaning every save to a repo they made throughout the growth of the project. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of Distributed Version Control System for saving data and changes to a file over time. It was created by the Linux company in 2005 after a dispute between Linux and BitKeeper (another Distributed VCS). Git was created to be faster, simpler, supportive of non-linear development (branches and group work), fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like those from the Linux kernel. Git is different from a VCS because instead of saving the differences in a file, git saves snapshots of the project as a whole. Every save to a project is stored as a reference. If there were no changes to a file, a link to the previous identical file is restored with the most current version of the file. Git is implemented by using text commands that are entered into the work directory’s terminal.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Throughout the process of creating and saving a file, Git takes three steps: Working Directory, Staging Area, and the Repository. While working on a file in the working directory, users can use the command “git add” to put a snapshot of the file into the staging area, which is like a waiting room for the file before the user uses the “git commit” command to put it in the local repo, or .git directory. The command “git push” pushes the files form the local repository to the remote repository. It is important to check the status of the file often, especially if working with a group because it shows what was changed since the last back up and what is currently in the staging area. This can be done with the command “git status”.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is part of the Versioning Control System because it is the server that saves all the data and edited files. There are two types of repositories: local and remote. A local repository saves the data on a single, local machine and is intended for one user. A remote repository is better for team projects because it saves the data on a remote server that share the data with multiple team members. Each member of a team can have their own local repo, but each team has one remote repo. The command “git clone” can be used to copy an existing project. This is helpful for team projects because multiple people can work on one project and merge everyone’s changes  (“git merge”) into one new, primary file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Working Directory is the work desk for all the coding and changes made to a project. In our LIS2360, the working directory is our Cloud9 workspace. The directory has a terminal used for git commands for file management and saving. When the user wants to add a file to the staging area from the working directory, they type “git add .” to add all the files connected to the project. The command “git commit” adds the files over to the local repository to be saved. To retrieve files from the remote repo, use command “git pull”, from the local repo, “git merge” or “git checkout”.</p>
